A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ECDFs or Empirical Cummulative Distribution Functions: \"is an estimate of the cumulative distribution function that generated the points in the sample. It converges with probability 1 to that underlying distribution. This cumulative distribution function is a step function that jumps up by 1/n at each of the n data points. Its value at any specified value of the measured variable is the fraction of observations of the measured variable that are less than or equal to the specified value.\" ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function)\n",
    "- Box Plots: \"In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Box plots may also have lines extending from the boxes (whiskers) indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be plotted as individual points. Box plots are non-parametric: they display variation in samples of a statistical population without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution.\" ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot)\n",
    "- Histograms: \"A histogram is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It was first introduced by Karl Pearson. To construct a histogram, the first step is to \"bin\" (or \"bucket\") the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent and are often (but not required to be) of equal size.\" ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)\n",
    "- KDEs or Kernel Density Estimation: \"In statistics, kernel density estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. Kernel density estimation is a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the population are made, based on a finite data sample. In some fields such as signal processing and econometrics it is also termed the Parzen–Rosenblatt window method, after Emanuel Parzen and Murray Rosenblatt, who are usually credited with independently creating it in its current form. One of the famous applications of kernel density estimation is in estimating the class-conditional marginal densities of data when using a naive Bayes classifier, which can improve its prediction accuracy.\" ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation)\n",

    "2. When trying to ask questions about large datasets, we can interrogate each piece of it using dask or the whole as we see fit. This would required creating partitions that make sense for your use case so that you can operate on both levels. For example, partition by dates if your dataset is time dependant, is an excellent approach.\n",
    "3. Desciptive statistics are useful in isolation and combination with other variables, especially when we have a lot of data and can split numerical values by categories to our hearts content.\n",
    "4. You can operate on each of your partitions as if it was a pandas dataframe using `.map_partitions()` method and either a custom made function or a one off lambda one.\n",
